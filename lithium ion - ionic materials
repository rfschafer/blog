Neat, long article about the history to current day lithium battery technologies. In this article, there is a newish company that will start to threaten, on some level, Anker at the end of this year! I don’t usually include a long commentary attached to a link, but based on my graduate research I can actually write one, which you can find under the below article.

What displeased and shocked me about this article is that there is no mention of branched chain organic semiconductors, apart from straight chain organic semiconductors denoted in the article as “solid polymer”. Carbon ion will be the next breakthrough for sure, but the breakthrough after that is in both branched chain and more complex organic semiconductors. I studied this research nine years ago during graduate school. 

There was a mountain of research articles on this in 2009, but this article fails to even give that technology one line. Sure, I understand the article was just about lithium ion, but for a science media source to miss this is truly embarrassing. I’m sure thousands of organic chemists, most likely including my grad advisor, are rolling their eyes at this article. Way to miss the forest for the trees Wired.
