Topic description: Lyft phasing out Power Driver Bonus

My take: Lyft is merely mimicking the weekly bonus structure that Uber has. Due to Uber's weekly bonus structure, I almost exclusively drive for Uber until I hit the first level of the bonus, then take requests at a first come first serve basis. Lyft has my attention with their weekly bonus restructuring though.

The new Lyft weekly bonus structure chops the weekly bonuses into M-Th and F-Su, like Uber. Furthermore, this change only benefits drive switchers, because this strategy has an inherent bonus.
